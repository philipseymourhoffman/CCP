# Cozy Chat Personalizer
## Welcome to the CCP
The Cozy Chat Personalizer is a user script that allows you to personalize the appearance of chat messages on CozyTV. With this script, you can customize the color of messages from specific users, including your own, and even make blocked users' messages imperceptible.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have a user script manager installed on your browser. We recommend using Tampermonkey for Chrome or Firefox, or Greasemonkey for Firefox.

Once you have a user script manager installed, simply copy the contents of the `cozy-chat-personalizer.js` file into a new user script, or use the "Install from URL" option in your user script manager and paste the following URL: 


## Usage

To use the Cozy Chat Personalizer, you'll need to customize the script by adding the usernames of the people you want to personalize in the respective categories, enclosed in quotes and separated by commas. You can also customize the color of messages by changing the hexcode value in the `targetColor` variable.

If you want the customized messages to appear in the same color as the username, set the `matchNameColor` variable to `true`.

Here are the categories you can customize:

- Target Users: YOU
- Target Users: FRIEND LIST
- Target Users: BLOCK LIST
- Target Users: MODWATCH


 ## Special thanks to Michael for giving me the motivation to go out of my way to create a blocklist
